	about: {
		title: "I’m the developer behind an intelligent MRI Brain Classification system.",
		description:
			"This project focuses on classifying brain tumors using MRI scans into four main categories: Meningioma, Pituitary, Glioma, and Healthy. Built using deep learning techniques, it aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and better treatment planning. The entire process—from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation—has been carefully designed for accuracy and real-world application. The project is open-source and welcomes collaboration to push boundaries in medical AI innovation.",
